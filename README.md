# InfoVis
[Data visualization for Rerb](https://big-bro222.github.io/InfoVis/)

This page presents an information visualization project based on **RER B incident email notifications** from 2013 to 2019, as part of the InfoVis class at Universit√© Paris-Saclay. Use ctrl - (command - for macOS) to resize the window if needed.
This visualization can be used to see trends in the number of RER incidents per day of the week, by month over the last 7 years. Each row represents a year, starting at 2013 from the top, and each column represents a month. Within each mini-visualization, the count of incidents per day of the week during that month is shown.
Looking at the visualization we can see a few interesting trends. The first apparent trend is that more incidents seem to occur during weekdays than on the weekends. Second, for the summer months there seems to be less incidents in July and August than in June, which could be a result of there being less people on the RER during the holidays. There also seems to be a spike in incidents during the second half of the week during August.
